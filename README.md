# AndroidVergeWallet
Android Verge wallet, concept (front-end) based on iOS repo

To get started, thanks to those who encourage me doing this. 

I haven't been doing some real dev (I do .NET, do you call this real? ) for few time so might be slow, but hey, I'm doing this for free and for Verge. 


If you're here you can join the trello related to it : https://trello.com/invite/b/QaWu6kiv/d858b93293c8179f184193e87b004838/verge-android-app.


Nothing to write here so far, I got started in a random way, still figuring out how to design this properly.



Sidenote : please be aware that the current apk on the store is easily decompilable and code isn't obfuscated. I know the reason why the verge wallet isn't on github and if you want to keep that in this way, obfuscate and release a new apk.
